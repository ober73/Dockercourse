DOCKER COURSE

Multiple choice exams

2013
Docker used to use LXC

2014
but then docker introduced libcontainer


OCI

runtime-spec
image-spec

2016 things were broken down volumes images etc

and runC emerged to run containers

also containerd was introduced to manage the containers

then containerd-shim was created so that containers would continue to run even if the docker daemon stopped. It is detached. 

Docker manages 4 things

images, networks, containers, Volumes

INSTALL

docker system info  


docker daemon

dockerd --debug (for debugging)


when started it listens on rpc Unix Socket

/var/run/docker.sock (only can access on localhost)


we can open up the cli to outside by running the daemon like this

dockerd --debug \
        --hots=tcp://192.168.1.10:2375 (our host interface)
        
        
on the other host you can access docker by setting a variable

export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.1.10:2375"


you can enable encryption

dockerd --debug \
        --host=tcp://192.168.1.10:2376 \
        --tls=true
        --tlscert=/var/docker/server.pem \
        --tlskey=/var/docker/serverkey.pem
        
unencrypted 2375
encrypted 2376

you can move these settings to the docker daemon file

/etc/docker/daemon.json

{
  "debug": true,
  "hosts": ["tcp://192.168.1.10:2376"]
  "tls": true,
  "tlscert": "/var/docker/server.pem",
  "tlskey": "/var/docker/serverkey.pem"
}
